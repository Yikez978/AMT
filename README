An anti-meterpreter network-based intrusion detection system and a bunch of security-info web crawlers.

Files
-----------
custom_snort_rules - Rules that can be placed into local rules in Snort and used for our experiment.
evaluation.py - Run evaluations with .pcap files without deploying AMT. Usage: python evaluation.py 1.pcap 2.pcap .... OR place your pcap files in ./pcaps and run python evaluation.py
decoder.py - To run the decoding of Meterpreter's 4 bytes XOR encoding offline. Usage: python decoder.py encoded_hexadecimal_string
AMT.py - Consist of all features of AMT except traffic analysis. Traffic Analysis portion has been written into another script for extension purposes in the near future.
AMTTA.py - Traffic Analysis on Windows x86 Meterpreter Sessions. 
extract_cve_details.py - An example of a web crawler used to crawl cvedetails.com to extract information and store it into a local database
extract_nvd_references.py - An example of extracting references from the NVD and crawling them. Custom crawlers need to be written to cover more sites. File includes securityfocus.com and securitytracker.com examples.

This guide has been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 and
Ubuntu 16.10, which comes with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5
# Install the following dependencies and libraries
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv

### In order to use the evaluation tool to test for false positive
# Install Scapy
$ sudo pip install scapy
$ sudo pip install scapy-ssl_tls

# Run evaluation.py using python 2.7 specifying a list of .pcap files. If
no parameters are found, evaluation.py searches all .pcap files in
directory /pcaps.
$ sudo python2.7 evaluation.py example1.pcap example2.pcap example3.pcap

### Running AMT in a proxy
# Enable ipv4 forward. Edit /etc/sysctl.conf to make this persistent
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Redirect traffic for evaluation
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i <interface> -p tcp -d <internal network> -j
    NFQUEUE --queue-num 1

# For persistence
$ sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent

# Install Netfilter (\& Scapy if you haven't)
$ sudo pip install NetfilterQueue

# Run AMT
$ sudo python2.7 AMT.py
